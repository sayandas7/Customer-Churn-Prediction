## Customer Churn Analysis & Prediction

# Introduction to Churn Analysis :
In todayâ€™s competitive business environment, retaining customers is crucial for long-term success. Churn analysis is a key technique used to understand and reduce this customer attrition. It involves examining customer data to identify patterns and reasons behind customer departures. By using advanced data analytics and machine learning, businesses can predict which customers are at risk of leaving and understand the factors driving their decisions. This knowledge allows companies to take proactive steps to improve customer satisfaction and loyalty.

# Who is the Target Audience?
Although this project focuses on churn analysis for a telecom firm, the techniques and insights are applicable across various industries. From retail and finance to healthcare and beyond, any business that values customer retention can benefit from churn analysis. We will explore the methods, tools, and best practices for reducing churn and improving customer loyalty, transforming data into actionable insights for sustained success.

# 1. Data Preparation
## a. Dataset:
~ A publicly available telecom customer churn dataset with columns for demographics, subscription details, and churn status.
## b. ETL Process:
### Extract:
~ Import the dataset into PostgreSQL using tools like pgAdmin or SQL scripts.
### Transform:
~ Clean and preprocess data using SQL queries to remove duplicates, handle missing values, and standardize formats.
### Load:
~ Store the processed data in structured tables for analysis.
# 2. Data Exploration
## a. Perform SQL queries to:
~ Analyze customer distribution by demographics (gender, age, etc.).

~ Calculate key metrics such as churn rate and customer retention.
## b. Use Power BI for exploratory visualizations:
~ Create charts to understand churn patterns.
# 3. Building the Model
## a. Data Integration:

~ Connect Power BI to the PostgreSQL database to load clean data.

~ Develop a star schema in Power BI for efficient modeling.

## b. Machine Learning:

### Use Python in Jupyter Notebook for model development.
~ Split data into training and testing sets.

~ Train a Random Forest classifier to predict churn.

~ Evaluate model accuracy and refine hyperparameters.


# 4. Results and Visualization
## a. Power BI Dashboard:

~Display Metrics on customer demographics and churn distribution.
~Visuals like bar charts, pie charts, and KPIs to present insights.
## b. Insights:

~Identify which customer segments are most likely to churn.
~Guide strategies for improving customer retention.
